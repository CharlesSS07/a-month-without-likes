# Maintaining virality
- Allow users to support the movement by enabling automated posts to their story
	- The posts would explain that the user is away for 30 days
	- Display a link explaining the challenge more, with option to sign up

# Wagers
- Users wager money to make sure they follow through
- Options for how wages work
	- Constant risk
	- Daily increasing risk
- Users who fail don't get their money back
- Maybe: users who win get their money multiplied by some amount
	- Could use this to pay for hosting, etc. and then give rest back to users
