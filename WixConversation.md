The following is a conversation with the WIX website builder AI.

Hi,

Let’s get started with your site setup.

**First, what do you want to call your site?**

A Month Without Likes

Great! "A Month Without Likes" is an interesting name for your site.

**What type of business are you running?**

An internet challenge based around putting down big social media applications for one month as a community. It's objectives are to help people stop scrolling, collect data on how social media changes us, and show the world what might happen if enough people stopped using the apps. We use wagers to keep users going, and pull in their usage data from the apps to keep them accountable and off the apps.

That sounds like an intriguing and impactful challenge you have! As an internet challenge, it's important to engage your users. **What kind of people do you want to attract to your site?**

We are looking for Instagram addicts, Twitter junkies, Facebook friends, and the chronically-online, in addition to non-addicts who want to perpetuate change, or know someone who can't seem to get off. Activists are welcome to help spread the word. We believe that social media is made for the people not the other way around. Think of A Month Without Likes as a unionization effort against big social media.

That's a broad range of audience! It's great that you're targeting both social media addicts and those who want to make a change. **Where is your business based or where do you primarily operate?**

I want to skip this question.

Sure, no problem. Moving on! **Tell me about the history of your business. How did it get started?**

The idea of all social media platforms coming to a screeching halt came to me on a drive with my brother. What if Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, etc. all stopped working? Would we find ourselves back in the 1990s? Would people fulfill their social needs through real communities rather than with their phones? Either way, we posited that this would be good for the world. Body dysmorphia, anti-social behaviors, anxiety, depression, and FOMO are a few of the well-known symptoms of the apps in question. We set out to topple the virtual social networks of the world, just to see if reality is better or worse. A Month Without Likes is a movement dedicated to simulating the effects of a big social media knockout by gaining a community with a large enough critical mass to see what happens when the apps slack.

That's a fascinating story behind the inception of your business! It's commendable that you're actively working to address the negative impact of social media on individuals. **Would you like to share any specific values or principles that your business follows?**

We acknowledge that not all social media is bad. But that many social media companies intend to build addictive products.

Understood. It's important to recognize the potential negative impact of addictive social media products. **What sets your business apart from similar initiatives or challenges in the market?**
